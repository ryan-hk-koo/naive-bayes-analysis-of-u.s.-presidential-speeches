# Naive Bayes Analysis of U.S. Presidential Speeches
Individual Project for Machine Learning Bootcamp

# Purpose
- Examine whether there is a discernible difference between Republican and Democrat presidential speeches using the Na誰ve Bayes Classifier
- Determine whether speeches by U.S. presidents from other political parties aligned more closely with Democratic or Republican rhetorical patterns using the Na誰ve Bayes Classifier developed above
- Visualize key rhetorical elements in Democratic and Republican speeches using word clouds and bar graphs

# Conclusion
- The Na誰ve Bayes Classifier achieved an accuracy of 88%, confirming a discernible difference between Republican and Democrat presidential speeches
- The Na誰ve Bayes Classifier's categorization of speeches from U.S. presidents of other political parties into Democratic and Republican categories aligned with historical facts regarding their parties, further attesting to the model's accuracy
- Visualizing key rhetorical elements highlighted distinct words in Democratic and Republican speeches, yet many were strikingly similar. This underscores the importance of employing the n-gram technique for a more nuanced analysis
