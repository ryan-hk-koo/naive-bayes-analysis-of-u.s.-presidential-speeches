# Naive Bayes Analysis of U.S. Presidential Speeches
Individual Project for Machine Learning Bootcamp

# Purpose
- Examine whether there is a discernible difference between Republican and Democrat presidential speeches using the Naïve Bayes Classifier
- Determine whether speeches by U.S. presidents from other political parties aligned more closely with Democratic or Republican rhetorical patterns using the Naïve Bayes Classifier developed above
- Visualize key rhetorical elements in Democratic and Republican speeches using word clouds and bar graphs

# Conclusion



Purpose, method, analysis, conclusion
The objective of this study is to forecast the unemployment rate of the next three months based on xyz
I will be make the forecasts, using x,y,z ML models for abc reasons
I’m using AUC as a mean to measure the performance of these models using cross validation
